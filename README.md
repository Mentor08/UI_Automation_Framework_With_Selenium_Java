# UI_Automation_Framework_With_Selenium_Java
This testing framework is built to foster understanding of testing automation. It is intended to be a reference tool for those transitioning into test automation with Selenium Java. In the project, Page Object Model(POM) design method is adopted and TestNG Listeners are implemented at the class level. This work is intended to be improved upon in subsequent commits/builds to have the TestNG listeners implemented at the suite/package level which will offer more flexibility to test cases execution and test management in general. 
Since it is intended to be a guide to both experienced and intermediate automation testers, or those new to selenium with Java, care is taken to ensure code is explained and waits used for slower execution inorder for users to experience every automated  action.
